# Crypto Clustering with Unsupervised Machine Learning
[Back to Portfolio](https://github.com/cindyd97/Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Cindy)
### Description: 
Clustering and unsupervised learning is used to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The data is prepared and normalized using the standardscaler() module from scikit-learn. The elbow method is applied to find the best k value with a for loop and inertia. The data is modeled and fitted using Kmeans. The data is simplified using PCA to reduce the amount of features in the data set. The data is plotted in a scatter-gram format to showcase the clusters of the data.
